Current plan

Have a portal through which users can create cases

--- A ---
    These cases get approved/edited by admins
    Once a case is approved, it gets sent to the map

--- B ---
    Admins enter information through portal
    As soon as case is created, it gets sent to map


PROBLEM 
    Map is currently stored on Google MyMaps. Can't send data to this programatically.
    Could use OpenStreetMaps for free, but it's a lot more work than intended.

Once this portal is up and running, port existing data into database

External API through which people can access info about cases
